Tyranno is an ultra-modern Python project generator and tool to sync project metadata to `pyproject.toml`.

Run `tyranno new my-org/my-project`.
Add `:tyranno:` comments where wanted and run `git commit` to sync and lint.
To test, run `tox` or open a pull request against the _main_ branch.
Merge or rebase to run final tests and update coveralls or codecov.
Push a semver tag to publish to PyPi, GitHub, GHCR, and Docker Hub.

Follow conventional commits to have pull requests auto-labeled and consistent release notes
generated to `CHANGELOG.md` and your GitHub Releases.
Generate Conda-Forge recipes with `tyranno recipe` and `environment.yaml` with `tyranno env`.
Run `tyranno reqs` to list or accept Poetry updates.

[üìö See the docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tyranno) for details.

## üé® Design / generating a new project

Don‚Äôt make 150 commits trying to configure CI/CD workflows. Tyranno's just works.

`tyranno new` generates ready-to-use Python projects with outstanding CI/CD.
Integrated with Docker Hub, the GitHub Container Registry, Azure, Conda-Forge,
and an array of linting, static analysis, security testing, documentation, dependency management, CI/CD tools,
and `:tyranno:` substitutions that reduce headaches.

It uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and
[no legacy files and tools](https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/#-the-python-build-landscape).
See below for a [comparison to other tools](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyranno#-similar-templates-and-tools).
Also see Tyranno‚Äôs little sister
[science-notebook-template üß™](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/science-notebook-template)
for scientific publication repos.

```bash
pip install tyranno
tyranno new https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git

# Cloned https://github.com/myorg/myproject.git
# See https://tyranno.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html
```

### üí° New project behavior

This section describes how freshly `tyranno new`-ed projects work.
However, you can swap out, modify, or disable anything as you see fit.
**[See the docs üìö](https://tyranno.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** for more information.

Here‚Äôs how your new project will behave when first set up, if appropriate secrets are set.

- **Commit** ‚áí Files are linted and verified for integrity.
- **Make a pull request** ‚áí Code is built and tested.
- **Push to the main branch** ‚áí Code is built and tested; code quality, coverage, and security badges are updated
- **Push a `v.*` tag** ‚áí Artifacts are sent to GitHub, PyPi, Docker Hub, the GCR, and readthedocs.
- `tox` ‚áí Tests are run locally
- `tyranno sync` ‚áí Project metadata is synced to pyproject.toml
- `tyranno reqs` ‚áí New dependency versions from PyPi and/or Conda are listed
- `tyranno clean` ‚áí Remove temp files

### üéØ Similar templates and tools

There are various other templates based on [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
and [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier). See which best suits your needs and style.

I designed Tyranno to solve issues with existing tools.
Here are features that other tools lack:

- An **elegant CI/CD workflow**: The workflow gets kicked off only via `git push` and GitHub releases.
- **Interoperability with Conda**, including recipes and environment files, by mapping dependencies and metadata.
- **Automated publishing** to PyPi, Conda-Forge, Docker Hub, the GitHub Container Registry, and readthedocs.
- **No duplication** between project files. (Not 100%: some duplication remains.)
- Built-in optional support for **extra/alternative tools**, such as Travis and codemeta.
- Complete **absence of legacy tools**, files, and Python 2 support.

**Notes:**

**‚Ä† _N int._**: Approximate number of built-in integrations with tools and standards. What counts is very roughly defined.
**‚Ä° _Modern_**: Lacks legacy files and tools. I‚Äôm including Make, setuptools, pipenv, and some others.
**Note:** [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) syncs with a remote template. It‚Äôs a neat idea that Tyranno lacks.

Some of the packages in the table above need more explanation:

- [hypermodern-python](https://github.com/cjolowicz/hypermodern-python)
  ([template](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python)), a Poetry-powered Python
  template. It‚Äôs good, but it made a few unusual choices, such as [Nox](https://github.com/theacodes/nox), which has <500 GitHub stars.
- Both [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) and
  [django-init](https://github.com/Fueled/django-init) have fantastic setups for Django projects.
- [Cookiecutter-docker-science](https://github.com/docker-science/cookiecutter-docker-science) is an interesting project
  that doesn‚Äôt quite fit in this list.
